Offline Data Visualation

**Goal**

This project is an experiment in using a web-based solution for viewing and interogatting offline data-sets. Since I've never used a web based layout tool, data visualization package, or loaded local data before I'm not going to worry about the architecture right now. The plan is to individually test each element of the project to learn how to use them first. Then once I'm familiar with how they function I can make educated decisions on the architecture of the app.

**Tasks**
- [X] Set-up [GoldenLayout](https://www.golden-layout.com) with some simple dummy containers.
- [ ] Set-up a [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com) scatter plot of dummy data, and then integrate it into a single GoldenLayout container.
- [ ] Set-up a [Slickgrid](http://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid) table in a GoldenLayout container.
- [ ] Load in a formatted data-set using Miso Project [Dataset](http://www.misoproject.com/dataset) and display it on the Highchart plot.
- Determine how much flexibility is required to make this project useful. Outline an architecture that would be reasonable and outline the remaining steps.
